## Questions! 
1. I need help with the sound. It plays way too loud and sounds very distorted!
2. I am working on game logic, but could use some guidance on making my telescope sprites actionable (change the game view on click)
3. I need help displaying a window of text for the "objects discovered" button. If possible, I don't want to have to deal with changing the view. 


# Summer-of-Code
Projects and Files from Summer of Code Internship with the Hamilton CS Department

## Motivation
I wanted to make a program that helped shed some light on the nighttime observation facilities at Hamilton. I included examples of what views real telescopes can see from Clinton, NY on a clear summer night. 

## Pre-Requisites 
You must have the python Arcade library installed. The program "observation_draft.py" will only run properly if the images and sounds folders are present. 

## Description and Instructions
Click the start window to enter the game. In the foreground are four different ways to 
observe the night sky! Simply click on one of the options to view the night sky, with the relative magnification power of each instrument (binoculars, small reflecting telescope, large refracting telescope, or observatory. Clicking on the observatory will generate a random specific celesital object in full view! The counter will keep track of the constellations that each player has seen, and information about each constellation is kept in the player's "notepad" which can be accessed at the bottom of the main game screen. Once all of the constellations are found, the game is over and an ending screen will display.
